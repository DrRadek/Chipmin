# Chipmin
 
## About
It's just a simple game where you produce, collect and sell microchips.

No story, no ending, no fancy graphics, just eternal suffering as expected from a game made in 3 days.

## How to play
1. You will start with enough money to buy the most basic factory. You can own up to 6 factories.

- Did you buy some upgrades before the factory? Don't worry, just restart the game (esc->New Game) 

- Be careful about buying next gen factories because doing so will destroy your old one with no refund.

2. There are two vans. You can put your chips there to sell them or to do research.

- You can use money to upgrade your factories, buy new ones or you can upgrade yourself

- Research is used to advance into next generation which upgrades better factories

3. That's it
